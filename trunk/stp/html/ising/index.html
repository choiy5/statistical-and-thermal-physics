The model consists of spinslocated on a lattice such that each spin can take on one of twovalues designated as up and down or &#177;1. The interaction energybetween two neighboring spins is -J if thetwo spins are in the same state and +J if they are in oppositestates. The Ising model undergoes a phase transition between an ordered and a disordered phase in two dimensions or more. We will consider the Ising model in the context of magnetism, but many other systems can be understood in terms of the Ising model.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The model was proposed by Wilhelm Lenz(1888&#150;1957) in 1920 and was solved exactly for theone-dimensional case by his student Ernst Ising in1925. The one-dimensional case doesnot have a phase transition. Lars Onsager(1903&#150;1976) solved the Ising model exactly in 1944 for twodimensions in the absence of an external magnetic field and showedthat there was a phase transition in two dimensions. No exact solution is available in two dimensions in an arbitrary magnetic field and in three dimensions. Hence, simulations of the Ising model are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total energy can beexpressed in the form</p><p class="center"><img src="isingenergy3.jpg" alt="" align="middle" >,</p><p>where s<sub>i</sub> =&#177;1 and J is the exchange constant. We will refer tos  as the spin.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simulations of the Ising model are available for <a href="ising1d/index.html">one dimension</a>, <a href="ising2d/index.html">square lattice (J &#62; 0)</a>, <a href="antiferromagnet/index.html">square lattice (J &#60; 0)</a>, and <a href="triangularlattice/index.html">triangular lattice (J &#60; 0)</a>.
