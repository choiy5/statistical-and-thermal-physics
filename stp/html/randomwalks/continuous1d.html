<h3 style="text-align:center;">One-Dimensional Random Walk with Variable Step Length</h3>

<p class="header_title">Introduction</p>

<p>An example of a continuous random variable is the displacement from the origin of a one-dimensional
random walker that steps at random to the right with
probability p, but with a step length that is chosen at <i>random</i>
between zero and the maximum step length a. The continuous
nature of the step length means that the displacement x of
the walker is a continuous variable.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can record the number of
times
H(x) that the displacement of the walker from the origin after N steps is in a bin of width
&#916;x between x and x + &#916;x. If the number of walkers that
is sampled is sufficiently large, we would find that
H(x) is proportional to the estimated probability that a
walker is in a bin of width &#916;x a distance x from the origin
after N steps. To obtain the probability, we divide H(x) by
the total number of walkers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In practice, the choice of the bin width is a compromise. If &#916;x
is too big, the features of the histogram would be lost. If &#916;x is
too small, many of the bins would be
empty for a given number of walkers, and our estimate of
the number of walkers in each bin would be less accurate.</p>

<p class="header_title">Problems</p>

<ol>


<li>Describe the qualitative features of the histogram for the displacement x after N steps. Does the qualitative features of the histogram change as the number of walkers is increased?</li>

<li>How does the variance depend on N for fixed p?</li>

<li>The simulation uses a step length with a uniform probability between 0 and 1. Calculate analytically the mean displacement and the variance for one step. (Remember that a step can be either to the left or the right and is of variable length.) Compare your analytical result to the result of the simulation for N = 1.</li>

<li>How does the variance found in the simulation after N steps compare to the variance for one step?</li>

<li>Explore the dependence of the histogram on the bin width. What is a reasonable choice of the bin width for N = 100?</li>
