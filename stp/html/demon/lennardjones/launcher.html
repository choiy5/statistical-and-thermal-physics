The output includes the velocity distribution and the (kinetic) temperature.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the equipartitiontheorem, the mean kinetic energy of a particle per degree of freedom iskT/2, wherek is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature. We can generalizethis relation to define the temperature at time t by</p><p class="center">kT(t) = (2/d) K(t)/N,</p><p>where K is the kinetic energy of the system at time t and d is the spatial dimension. In the following we will choose d = 2.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temperature that is measured in a laboratory experiment is the mean temperature which corresponds tothe time average of T(t) over many configurations of the particles. Fortwo dimensions we write the mean temperature T as</p><p class="center"><img src="kT.jpg" alt="" align="middle" ></p><p>(The bar denotes the time average.)</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above relation holds only if the momentum of the center of mass of the system is fixed. In a laboratory system the walls of thecontainer ensure that the center of mass motion is zero (ifthe mean momentum of the walls is zero). In a simulation,we impose the constraint that the center of massmomentum (in each of the d directions) be zero. Consequently, thesystem hasdN - d independent velocity components rather than dNcomponents, so that the correction expression for the mean temperature is</p><p class="center"><img src="kTfinite.jpg" alt="" align="middle" ></p><p>The presence of the factor (N - 2) rather than N inis an example of a finite sizecorrection that becomes unimportant for large N.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above definition of the mean temperature  defines the <i>kinetic</i> temperature. We now use the demon algorithm to demonstrate that the demon gives an independent measure of the temperature. Because the finite size effects are different for the two measurements, you will find that the two measurements will be slightly different.</p><center><applet code="org.opensourcephysics.davidson.applets.ApplicationApplet.class" archive="./stp.jar" codebase="../" align="top" height="40" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="150"> <param name="target"value="org.opensourcephysics.stp.demon.mdDemon.LJParticlesDemonApp"> <param name="title" value="Applet"> <param name="singleapp" value="true"></applet></center><p>Problems will be given soon.</p><p class="header_title">Java Classes</p><ul><li>LJParticlesDemonApp</li><li>LJParticlesDemon</li><li>LJParticlesDemonLoader</li></ul><p class = "small">Updated 13 May 2008.</p></body></html>
