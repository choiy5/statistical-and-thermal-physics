<h3 style="text-align: center;">Mean-field solutions of the Ising model</h3>

<p class="header_title">Introduction</p>
<p>The program solves the mean-field equation for the Ising model</p>
<p class="center">
m = tanh &#946;(Jqm + B),
</p>
<p>where &#946; = 1/kT, T is the absolute temperature, k is Boltzmann's constant, B is the external magnetic field, q is the number of nearest neighbors of a given spin, J is the exchange constant, and m is the magnetization per spin. (A factor of &#956; has been absorbed into B.) This equation for m is a <i>self-consistent</i>
transcendental equation. That is, the
mean-field that influences the mean value of m depends 
on the mean value of m.

<p class="header_title">Algorithm</p>

<p>The program is relatively simple and uses Newton's method to find the zeros of the function g(m) = m - tanh &#946;(Jqm + B).
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solutions correspond to the high
temperature disordered paramagnetic state (m = 0) and the low temperature ordered
ferromagnetic state (m &#8800; 0). How do we know which solution to choose?
The answer can be found by determining the free energy for both solutions and
choosing the solution that gives the smaller free energy. It can be shown that the free energy per spin is</p>

</p>
<p>For simplicity we measure the temperature in units of J/k, which is equivalent to setting J = k = 1 in the program.</p>

<p class="header_title">Problems</p>

<ol>

<li>Choose q = 4, corresponding to the square lattice. Set B = 0 and determine the value of the critical tempeprature T<sub>c</sub> such that m &#8800; 0 for T &#8804; T<sub>c</sub> and m = 0 for T &#62; T<sub>c</sub>.</li>

<li>Given that m = 1 at T = 0 and is zero at T = T<sub>c</sub>, obtain a sufficient number of numerical solutions for T &#60; T<sub>c</sub> so that you can plot m as a function of T. Does m go to zero continuously as T approaches T<sub>c</sub> from below?</li>

<li>Choose q = 2, corresponding to a one-dimensional lattice. Does mean-field theory predict that T<sub>c</sub> &#62; 0 or T<sub>c</sub> = 0? Compare the mean-field solution to the exact result for T<sub>c</sub> in one dimension.</li>
