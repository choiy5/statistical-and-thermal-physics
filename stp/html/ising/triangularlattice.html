Do you expect the physical properties ofthe triangular Ising model with J = + 1 or J = -1 to be qualitatively different from the properties of the Ising model on a square (or rectangular) lattice? The following figure illustrates the nature of the triangular lattice.</p><p class="center"><img src="triangle4.jpg" alt="" align="middle" ></p><p>Note that the coordination number, the number of nearest neighbors, is six. What is the coordination number of the square lattice?</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Recall that for J &#62; 0, the energy is minimized when neighboring spins are parallel. If J &#60; 0, the energy is minimized when neighboring spins are antiparallel. As we will see, changing the number of nearest neighbors changes everything. Look at the figure below. The spin at the site denoted by a question mark is frustrated. If it is antiparallel to one neighbor, it must be parallel to the other neighbor. On a triangular lattice, it is impossible for all neighbors to have opposite spins. The system is <i>frustrated</i> because it cannot achieve a state where all the spins have neighbors that are antiparallel. (This type of frustration is geometrical in nature in contrast to the frustration associated with a spin glass in which the exchange constant J is randomly chosen to be &#177; 1.)</p><p class="center"><img src="frustrate.jpg" alt="" align="middle" ></p><center><applet code="org.opensourcephysics.davidson.applets.ApplicationApplet.class" archive="./stp.jar" codebase="../" align="top" height="40" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="150"> <param name="target" value="org.opensourcephysics.stp.ising.ising2d.IsingTriangularAntiApp"> <param name="title" value="Applet"> <param name="singleapp" value="true"></applet></center><p class="header_title">Problems</p><ol><li>Run the simulation at various temperatures and qualitatively describe the configurations.</li><li>We know the Ising model on a square lattice with J &#62; 0 or J &#60; 0 has a phase transition.
